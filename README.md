# ClickSafe: A Chrome Extension to Avoid Clickbait

Ever opened a video or article out of curiosity before you realized it was clickbait? Save your time and keep your computer secure by using ClickSafe, a Chrome extension that notifies you if a link is clickbait while attempting to satisfy your curiosity in a safe manner.

The curiosity gap is the space between what we know and what we want or even need to know. This is what folks who create click-bait titles and thumbnails leverage to get users interested in their content - they write something very appealing at first glance, but not true to the actual content. Our project attempts to alert users to those sorts of clickbait items when they do inevitably click outgoing links on a social media platform, and additionally tries to satisfy user’s perceptions of said content by giving a short description of what items are actually in the content body. Let us introduce Clicksafe, a browser extension that warns users upon trying to open a clickbait YouTube video.

ClickSafe's goal is to teach everyday users of technology how to spot clickbait content. While our current project is focused on clickbait YouTube videos which are more irksome than actually dangerous, users that open links to clickbait articles can inadvertently install malicious software on their machines. Our hope is to extend ClickSafe so that it can work on all major social media sites, like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and TikTok.
